## The essence of teaching

The problem with these attempts to revolutionise teach

## The bionic teacher

## The atomised teacher

## Monitoring, observability and micro-assessment

## What sort of revolution do we want?

It's tempting to read these ideas with an eye to efficiency - education is expensive, and a big part of that expense is the teachers, so you

And we could achieve some efficiencies here. But the goal shouldn't simply be to deliver our current educational output more cheaply. Remember that all the "revolutions" we have seen in recent memory have precipitated massive _increases_ in spending - the microcomputer may have made computing cheaper but in the process we spent much more on computers, because they delivered exponentially more value than what preceeded them.

Our education systems leave so many learners behind, with real consequences that echo throughout a lifetime. It balances on super-educators - elusive unicorns that can deliver high-quality education - and in practice very few people measure up to that impossible standard, burning out while trying.

A true revolution in education could harness the unique talents and abilities of teachers, combining them in cross-functional teams that could deliver consistently excellent educational experiences - experiences that endure the absence of any individual educator. A true revolution in education could lift any learner out of their socioeconomic context, levelling the playing field and empowering everyone with access to skilled, meaningful, secure employment.

It's not just about less teachers and bigger classrooms. It's about systemic change - a revolution in education makes education more valuable.
