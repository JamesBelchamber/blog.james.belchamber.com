# Services

I offer a range of services, from consultancy to off-the-shelf solutions. If you don't see something you need but you like what you do see, why not [email me](mailto:james@belchamber.com) and see what we build together?

## Web/Dev/Ops/Infrastructure/Sysadmin Consultancy

No matter what you call it, if you need to get to grips with the technology that underpins your business or the development workflow that feeds it, I can help.

## IJAWS (It's Just A WebSite!)

For those that just need a web presence, but don't want to maintain one: standard template, re-usable content, easy blogging.

Got a big organisation with lots of websites? I can deploy a version of this that allows you to upload content once, and display it on many websites. Get everyone to contribute and share the load!

## MMET (Multi-directional Membership Engagement Tool)

Do you need to track members? Get them to pay subscriptions? Send them newsletters? Get them to talk to each other? MMET is the service for you! Built out of Open Source components and provided as a service, you can both enjoy a zero-maintenance Website, CRM and Community Forums, and know you're not locked in to a single provider.
